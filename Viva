62. In a singly linked list, each node contains a data and pointer to the **next node**.  
63. In infix to postfix conversion, operators are processed based on their **precedence and associativity**.  
64. In a Binary Search Tree (BST), the left child of a node contains values **less than** the node, and the right child contains values **greater than** the node.  
65. An AVL tree is a type of binary search tree that is **height-balanced**.  
66. Breadth-First Search in graph traversal uses a **queue** data structure.  
67. In Bubble Sort, the largest element moves to the **last** position after each pass.  
68. Selection Sort finds the **smallest** element in each pass and moves it to its correct position.  
69. In Linear Search, each element is checked **one by one**, whereas Binary Search repeatedly divides the list in **half**.  
70. Binary Search is efficient only on a **sorted** list.  
71. In Hashing with Linear Probing, if a collision occurs, we check the **next** position until an empty slot is found.  
72. In Hashing with Quadratic Probing, if a collision occurs, the next position is found using a **quadratic** sequence.  
73. In Insertion Sort, elements to the left of the current element are **sorted**, and the current element is placed in its correct position.  
74. In an AVL tree, if the balance factor of a node is greater than **1** or less than **-1**, a rotation is needed to balance it.  
75. In linear probing, if a collision occurs at index 5, **6** will be the next index checked.
